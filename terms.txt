The template is HTML markup, peppered with tags that will either insert variables or run programming logic.

A template engine enables you to use static template files in your application. At runtime, the template engine replaces variables in a template file with actual values, and transforms the template into an HTML file sent to the client.

Layouts usually contain <!DOCTYPE html><html><head>....</head><body>) and conclusion (</body></html>). Then the original view file is included using <%- body %>. Layouts are never used without a view.
